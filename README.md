# InfinityBinaryInteger
InfinityBinaryInteger is Special Utility of express numbers correctly and no "error like floating point".
ibi is integer class
ibr is rational number class
ibc is complex number class

they are developed for making correct math reserch program.

ibi integer provide follow operations
: =, >, <, >=, <=, ==, +, -, *, /, %, pow, sqrt_approximate, get_new_prime, PrimeFactorization, nCr, nPr, nHr, factorial, unaryPlus...

ibr rational number provide follow operations
: =, >, <, >=, <=, ==, +, -, *, /, exp_approximate(exponetial, sqrt ...), nCr, nPr, nHr, factorial, unaryPlus ...
